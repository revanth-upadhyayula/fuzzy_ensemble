        <p>1. <strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> Your uploaded image is normalized, resized, and augmented to match the input requirements of each model in our ensemble.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Parallel Inference:</strong> The image is processed through each of our five base models simultaneously to generate individual predictions.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Fuzzy Aggregation:</strong> A set of fuzzy rules evaluates the reliability of each modelâ€™s predictions based on image characteristics and confidence distributions.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Membership Function Application:</strong> Confidence scores are refined through fuzzy membership functions that account for model-specific biases and tendencies.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Defuzzification:</strong> The final step combines the weighted predictions into a coherent output with well-calibrated confidence scores.</p>
