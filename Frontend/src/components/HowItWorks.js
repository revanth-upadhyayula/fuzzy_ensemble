            <h3>Multi-Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Our system combines predictions from multiple deep learning architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer, DenseNet, and MobileNet) to leverage the strengths of each model while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

            <h3>Fuzzy Logic Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of simple averaging or voting, we employ fuzzy logic rules to weight each modelâ€™s output based on its historical performance with similar images. This allows the system to adaptively trust specific models more in contexts where they excel.

            <h3>Uncertainty Quantification</h3>
            <p>
              Our fuzzy-ensemble provides confidence scores that are well-calibrated and accurately reflect prediction uncertainty, unlike standard softmax outputs which often produce overconfident results even when wrong.
